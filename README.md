This code uses Markmov Autorgressive model to generate a new word based on the k most recent previous words. K is chosen to be a small fixed constant. I got the input data from Project Gutenberg, a free library of public-works books online. I used four books to train the model:
  - Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll
  - Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka
  - The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas
  - The Complete Works of William Shakespeare by William Shakespeare
